## Releases

This GitHub action is strongly typed and uses [github-actions-typing](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-actions-typing) to type its inputs and outputs. 

In order to work with [github-workflows-kt](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-workflows-kt), releases must use semver and a branch must point to the last patch version for each major version (you can read more [here](https://typesafegithub.github.io/github-workflows-kt/user-guide/using-actions/#requirements-for-adding-a-new-action)https://typesafegithub.github.io/github-workflows-kt/user-guide/using-actions/#requirements-for-adding-a-new-action).

In order to make a release:

* tag the current version: `vx.y.z`
* update the major branch to the latest release
* push everything
